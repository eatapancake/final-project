# My Recipe Book

## Motivation:
The motivation for My Recipe Book stems from the frustration of forgetting successful recipes that worked well.
 Sometimes, it's just easier and more convient to have documents on an app where you can access anywhere and know that they are safe from being lost. I wanted
this app to help users keep all their recipes in one location so that they're not scattering aroung the internet and printing out multiple recipes that they've done 
in the past. 

## Current Status of the app:
At the moment, the app is still in it's early phase. The app is unable to store multiple recipes from the users. Right now what it can do is have the user input their information of the 
recipes, and there are 3 samples of how the recipe app will display the information to the user. Also, the user is able to add as much or as little ingredients that the recipe needs, as well as the amount of steps.
